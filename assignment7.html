            In this assignment, we finish our molds and cast!

                Here was my final mold for mold from last week:
                </br> </br>

                </br> </br>
                Since the 3D print took ~11.5 hours and Oomoo takes 10 hours to set without babysitting, I chose to Oomoo these molds twice since the object is symmetrical. I decided to Oomoo both the small scale and the larger Pokeball. I bought mixing cups, popsicle sticks, funnels, paper clips, and rubber bands additionally for this assignment.
                </br> </br>
                I had barely enough Oomoo :(! But I was able to have enough to create the molds. HOWEVER, it took sweat and tears (and luckily not blood), to get these molds out! Although I had detachable walls, the surface tension was very high. The small scale came out easily, but not so much with the large scale. I ended up using a cup to push the center out with my full body weight and hands on the edges. I have bruises on my hands and sore arms and took about 1 hour per Oomoo, so 2 hours total to get the molds separated from the 3D prints.

                </br> </br>
                This next part I forgot to take pictures of since I was wearing lots of protective gear and doing it outside since I didn't want any casting material in the house nearby the kitties. First, I applied the recommended lubrication spray. Then, I mixed my Perfect Cast and used small plastic funnels placed in the sprue to pour it in. I accidentally overfilled both when trying to pour, I tapped the edges to ensure it settled down and wiped away the excess. I also barely had enough Perfect Cast! I waited 45 min to remove the casts from the molds.
                </br> </br>
                The small scale removed just fine. The larger scale first half removed fine, but the second half the hole maker extension of the mold ripped off. If I had moved slower, I probably could've prevented this from ocurring. The hole at the bottom did turn out great though!

                However, there is a noticeable seam and defect at the top.

                </br> </br>
                I think this may have to do with the overflow while pouring with the funnel and too much air, however I do not have enough Perfect Cast to try again. Plus, these issues can be fixed with sanding and the final painting of the Pokeball to come next. Stay tuned for how I finish and reuse this Pokeball for my final project!
