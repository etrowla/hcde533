            Ultimate Pokemon Starter Set: A starter set for the Pokemon enthusiast with a bit of flair! Great for office, bedroom, or game room displays!
            </br> </br>
            Have all that you need to get a taste of the Pokemon world with the starter Pokemon (custom modified), a Pokeball (a representative object of your Pokemon’s home), and Pokemon cards to understand the traits and skills of your starter Pokemon.
            </br> </br>
            Includes 3 parts:
            </br>
            <dl>
                <dt>1. Pokemon:</dt>
                    <dd>Techniques: Rhino - mesh editing (1), 3D printing (2)</dd>
                    <dd>Starter Pokemon STLs are custom modified with additional objects</dd>
                <dt>2. Pokeball:</dt>
                    <dd>Techniques: Mold design and casting (3), Rhino - direct modeling, 3D printing, Grasshopper (4)</dd>
                    <dd>Casted Pokeball is painted and has a 3D printed stand</dd>
                <dt>3. Pokemon cards (stretch goal):</dt>
                    <dd>Techniques: Laser cutting (5), Rhino, 3D printing, Stock parts (6)</dd>
                    <dd>Decorative clear arcylic cards with stand are illuminated with LEDs</dd>
            </dl>
            </br> </br>
            Pokemon details:</br>
            The Pokemon include mesh edited additional objects like the rose on bulbasaur.

            </br> </br>
            Pokeball details:</br>
            Pokeball is finished with sanding and paint. Grasshopper-designed stand will fit into the hole at the bottom of Pokeball.

            </br> </br>
            Pokemon card details:</br>
            Pokemon card is inspired by existing glass/aryclic decorative pieces.

            </br> </br>
            Pokemon card details will be rastered onto the arcylic and illuminated by LEDs in the 3D printed base.
