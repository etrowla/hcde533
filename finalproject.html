            Ultimate Pokemon Starter Set: A starter set for the Pokemon enthusiast with a bit of flair! Great for office, bedroom, or game room displays!
            </br> </br>
            Have all that you need to get a taste of the Pokemon world with the starter Pokemon (custom modified), a Pokeball (a representative object of your Pokemon’s home), and Pokemon cards to understand the traits and skills of your starter Pokemon.
            </br> </br>
            Includes 3 parts:
            </br>
            <dl>
                <dt>1. Pokemon:</dt>

                    <dd>Starter Pokemon STLs are custom modified with additional objects</dd>
                <dt>2. Pokeball:</dt>
                    <dd>Techniques: Mold design and casting (3), Rhino - direct modeling, 3D printing, Grasshopper (4)</dd>

                <h4>BOM:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Pokemon STLs: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:327753">Bulbasaur</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:323038">Charmander</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:319413">Squirtle</a>, and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:376601">Pikachu</a></li>

                    </ul>
                <h4>How it was done:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Ordered relevant PLA colors</li>
                    <li>Downloaded starter Pokemon STLs (Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Charmander) + Pikachu from Thingiverse</li>
                    <li>Downloaded STLs of objects: Rose, Fire, and Squad Glasses </br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>I discovered on Thingiverse that someone had already crafted the famous Squirtle ‘Squad’ Glasses as a remix that fits with the existing Squirtle.</li>
                        </br> </br>
                        <img src="finalproject/pokemon/squadglasses.png" width=500></a>
                        </br> </br>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Rhino mesh editing, ensure scale and closed meshes -> export new STLs </br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>I combined the rose and the Bulbasaur by splitting off the current Bulbasaur plant and scaling, reducing the rose mesh, and unioning them together.</li>
                        <li>[see also <a href="assignment5.html">assignment 5</a> for bulbasaur beginnings]</li>

                        </br> </br>
                        <li>I applied a similar approach to the fire on the Charmander. I had to be careful when aligning the fire on Charmander’s tail, as unioning them resulted in an open mesh. I reduced the mesh and combined further down on the tail to ensure a closed mesh.</li>
                        </br> </br>
                        <img src="finalproject/pokemon/charmanderprogress.png" width=500></a>
                        </br> </br>
                        <li>I decided to keep the squad glasses as a separate object worn by Squirtle rather than unioning them to its face. </li>
                        <li>In addition, since I could not find a satisfactory lightning bolt/other object for Pikachu, I printed just a normal Pikachu.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Go to Cura and determine print settings.</br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Needed tree supports and brim.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Loaded relevant PLA color and 3D printed! </br>

                        <ul>
                        <li>Most issues occurred with Pikachu, but with a properly leveled 3D printer, a much cleaner bed, brim supports, and the help of my friend, they were able to be printed.</li>
                        </br> </br>

                        <li>In addition the squad glasses for Squirtle were weak in their design. I tried to reinforce the temples of the glasses with superglue, but it didn’t stick. So, I opted for the more noticeable hot glue.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h4>How it was done:</h4>
                    [see also <a href="assignment6.html">Assignment 6</a> and <a href="assignment7.html">7</a>]
                    <ul>
                    <li>Downloaded Pokeball STL from Thingiverse</br>
                        <ul><li>I found a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1671448/files">pokeball</a> stl from Thingiverse and reduced the mesh down so it would be more manageable.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Made a 2 part mold for mold in Rhino with direct modeling/mesh operations (ensured to design keys, sprue, and any needed vents)</br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>I was deciding on what the optimal way to cut the pokeball in half was. Along the indentation in the ball might be nice to hide the seam, but I was worried then the lip wouldn't fill out correctly since it was so small even if I put in extra vents. So, I decided to cut it the opposite direction and live with a potential seam with the sprue coming out of the front button of the pokeball. </li>
                        </br> </br>
                        <img src="finalproject/pokeball/pokeballrhino.png" width=500></a>
                        </br> </br>
                        <li>Jessica reminded me of Nadya's point in class that it can be hard to get the molds out and to build the walls separately, so that is what I did. I decided to start with a small scale test to see if my tolerances, measurements, and meshes were okay upon printing in a shorter amount of time. I printed a very small 4cm version of my pokeball mold.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>3D print the mold for mold</br>
                            <ul>
                            <li>I scaled up my STL in Cura by 250%, which would me I would fit a pokeball about the size of my hand.
                            </br>
                            <img src="finalproject/pokeball/pokeballscaled.png" width=500></a>
                            </br> </br> </li>
                            <li>Luckily, right before I kicked off my 14 hour print, Noelle posted about her settings that printed faster. I changed my layer height to 0.4mm, which cut down the print time by about 4 hours!
                            </br> </br>
                            <img src="finalproject/pokeball/molds.png" width=500></a>
                            </br> </br> </li>
                            <li>Since the pokeball is symmetrical I am going to oomoo this mold twice since it takes just as long to print another one and oomoo I don't have to babysit :).</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Used ‘oomoo’ to create the mold and cast with ‘Perfect Cast’/hydrostone within the ‘oomoo’ mold </br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>I decided to Oomoo both the small scale and the larger Pokeball. I bought mixing cups, popsicle sticks, funnels, paper clips, and rubber bands additionally for this assignment. </li>
                        </br>
                        <li>I had barely enough Oomoo :(! But I was able to have enough to create the molds. HOWEVER, it took sweat and tears (and luckily not blood), to get these molds out! Although I had detachable walls, the surface tension was very high. The small scale came out easily, but not so much with the large scale. I ended up using a cup to push the center out with my full body weight and hands on the edges. I have bruises on my hands and sore arms and took about 1 hour per Oomoo, so 2 hours total to get the molds separated from the 3D prints.
                        </br> </br>
                        <img src="finalproject/pokeball/oomoo.png" width=500></a>
                        </br> </br> </li>
                        <li>This next part I forgot to take pictures of since I was wearing lots of protective gear and doing it outside since I didn't want any casting material in the house nearby the kitties. First, I applied the recommended lubrication spray. Then, I mixed my Perfect Cast and used small plastic funnels placed in the sprue to pour it in. I accidentally overfilled both when trying to pour, I tapped the edges to ensure it settled down and wiped away the excess. I also barely had enough Perfect Cast! I waited 45 min to remove the casts from the molds. </li>
                        </br>
                        <li> The small scale removed just fine. The larger scale first half removed fine, but the second half the hole maker extension of the mold ripped off. If I had moved slower, I probably could've prevented this from ocurring. The hole at the bottom did turn out great though! </li>
                        </br>

                        </br> </br>
                        <li>However, there is a noticeable seam and defect at the top. These issues can be fixed with sanding and the final painting of the Pokeball to come next.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Sanded Pokeball and painted Pokeball</br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>I used a sandpaper/block to sand the seam down.</li>
                        <li>I also 3D-printed small tubes to paint the center button black lines around to ensure a better circle since ridges were reduced in the sanding process.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Designed stand for Pokeball in Rhino with Grasshopper (fits in hole in bottom of Pokeball) and 3D printed Pokeball stand </br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>After measuring the hole and estimating the depth of hole with my caliper. I began designing the stand in Grasshopper. It was best to design this in Grasshopper in case I needed to easily adjust the dimensions based on the fit in the Pokeball.</li>
                        <li>I designed a simple stand of two cylinders unioned together in Grasshopper</li>

                <h4>BOM:</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>5x7 acrylic sheets</li>
                <li>Pokemon vector art</li> 
                <li>Stock part of LED lamp base</li>
                <li>Batteries</li>
                <li>Laser cutter</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How it was done:</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Ordered relevant materials: acrylic, LED lamp bases</br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Originally I was thinking I would have to order LEDs separately and 3D print lamp stands/bases. However, I realized there were lamp bases with a slot for acrylic readily available and ordered those to be my stock part instead.</li>

                    </br> </br>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Downloaded vectors of Pokemon cards for each Pokemon and edited in Illustrator.</br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Since there were not complete vectors of Pokemon cards available, I decided to create them myself from the advice from Petrina using Illustrator.</li>
                    <li>I bought Pokemon vector art off of <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1252428063/pokemon-svg-pokemon-characters-pokemon">Etsy</a> and combined them with my own designs, using information on Pokemon attacks from existing Pokemon card information.</li>
                    <li>Since I did not have the lamp bases yet, I went off of measurements from online documentation to cut the bottom lip to insert into the base. Each artboard in Illustrator was the size of my acrylic sheet.</li>

                    </br> </br>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Went to the MILL laser cut the acrylic sheets and raster the vectors of the Pokemon card information</br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>All lines needing to be cut were modified in Illustrator to be 0.01pt while raster vectors remained unmodified.</li>
                    <li>I utilized the settings on the material sheet at the Mill for settings, using the 600DPI engrave settings and 3mm cutting settings based off the width of the acrylic.</li>

                    </br> </br>
                    <li>I used the 2 extra pieces of acrylic to test alignment in the laser cutter with the help of Jessica.</li>

                    </br> </br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Unfortunately the Bublasaur card got a few scratches from the laser cutter and I was out of extra pieces, but overall the cards look great with their Pokemon!</li>
                    <li>I assembled each lamp by adding in batteries and changing the color of the LED to match the Pokemon color.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
