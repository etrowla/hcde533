                So, let us begin with acknowledging the many mental barriers and pressures during the week of this assignment. First of all, I struggle assembling IKEA furniture, so I knew this was going to be a big hurdle for me. Then, other personal barriers going on, such as, layoffs at work and not being able to see 10 ft in front of you due to smoke to name a few. Anyways, after 3 breakdowns and ~25 hours of time thinking, learning, assembling and printing, it is done!
                </br> </br>
                I had already started some of the assembly ahead of time but it still took me multiple days to get through it, but also was lucky to learn from my classmates who had gotten an even further head start. Miranda was kind enough to send me the videos she used as a resource: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q">Assembly</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Z3GmM20JM">Software and Settings</a>. I learned I likely would need to adjust my z-limit switch from Andy's post as my nozzle was not getting close enough. I adjusted this and began the leveling protocol linked in the assignment.

                </br> </br>
                It took a few tries to get right, but eventually I was able to adjust the knobs underneath to be level. Here's my final setup:

                </br> </br>
                I then designed a cube in Rhino using Grasshopper because I did have fun using it last week!
                </br> </br>
                <img src="assignment3files/gh.png" width=500></a>
                </br> </br>
                Here are the cube print times and sizes:
                </br> </br>
                Cube 1 </br>

                <img src="assignment3files/cube1size.png" width=500></a>
                </br> </br>
                Cube 2 </br>

                </br> </br>
                Cube 3 </br>
                <img src="assignment3files/cube3time.png" width=500></a>
                </br> </br>
                <img src="assignment3files/cube3size.png" width=500></a>
                </br> </br>
                Cube 4 </br>
                <img src="assignment3files/cube4time.png" width=500></a>
                </br> </br>
                <img src="assignment3files/cube4size.png" width=500></a>
                </br> </br>
                Luckily, all of them turned out to be within 1mm of the desired size, so I didn't adjust anything on my printer before moving onto tubes and cylinders. I did accidentally move the glass plate during removal of one of the cubes, so I did relevel in between prints. Shoutout to Jessica for teaching me to pat the top and side of the cube to get it off the plate!
                </br> </br>
                I had issues getting to export correctly from Rhino to Cura, it would show as a box instead of circular. Petrina provided a fix with maximum export angle, which worked. Professor Nadya later followed up that this was a bug in Rhino and to convert extrusion in the future.

                For my nested object, I was pretty exhausted with little left in the provided filament, so I decided to keep it simple. I created small nested tubes.
