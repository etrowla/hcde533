            My name is Emily Rowland! I'm an HCDE master's student in my final quarter in the program! </br>
        I am currently a Product Manager and have been focusing on user research and product ethics while in the HCDE program. </br>
        I am excited to learn about creating 3D objects outside of the screen, a topic I have shied away from in the past.
