                When first thinking of building a kit of shapes that fit together, I was instantly reminded of my time back in organic chemistry class. We drew many hexagons and played with 3D models of molecules.
                </br> </br>
                So, I thought a hexagon shape would be perfect for this assignment to look similar to organic structures.
                </br> </br>
                Initially, I created a structure with deep slots, 5mm wide with cambered edges. My cardboard thickness ranged from 4.8-5mm, so I thought that with would be appropriate.
                </br> </br>
                Then, I learned from Jessica after her trial run of cutting that exactly the width doesn't ensure a tight fit. So, I reduced my slot width to 4mm and exported to illustrator to scale (another thing I learned from Jessica!).
                </br> </br>
                Here was my initial curve:
